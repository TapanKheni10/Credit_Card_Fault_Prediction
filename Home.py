Despite high returns, credit cards carry significant risks. The ever-expanding number of credit cards has achieved an expansion in 
how much credit card defaults and the subsequent enormous measure of bills and repayment data information have likewise carried specific 
hardships to the risk controllers. As a result, one of the primary concerns of banks is how to use the data generated by users and extract 
useful information to control risks, reduce the default rate, and control the growth of non-performing assets.
